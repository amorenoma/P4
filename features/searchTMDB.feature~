Feature: User can add movie by searching for it in The Movie Database (TMDb)

  As a movie fan
  So that I can add new movies without manual tedium
  I want to add movies by looking up their details in TMDb

Background: Start from the Search form on the home page

  Given I am on the RottenPotatoes home page
  Then I should see "Search TMDb for a movie"



Scenario: Try to add movie with an invalid one

  When I fill in "Search Terms" with "Psycho"
	And I have an invalid api_key
  And I press "Search TMDb"
  Then I should be on the RottenPotatoes home page
  And I should see "Search not available"
